# ⚖️ SKY LEGAL STANDARD (SLS)

**SKY LEGAL STANDARD (SLS)** is a taxonomy/ontology project designed to standardize the organization and tagging of legal data. The file `SL-V1.owl` contains the primary ontology in OWL/XML format, defining tags with unique IRIs to ensure consistency and interoperability across systems.

## **Key Features (Example Applied to French Law)**

1. **Standardized Taxonomy for French Legal Systems**:  
   SLS can model tags tailored to French law. For example:  
   - **Area of Law**: "Droit administratif" (Administrative Law).  
   - **Service**: "Contentieux" (Litigation).  
   - **Forum/Venue**: "Conseil d'État" (Council of State).  

   This structure enables precise categorization and tagging of cases, decisions, and legal matters in the French judicial system.

2. **Improved Interoperability**:  
   By adopting SLS, French legal organizations (e.g., courts, law firms, public agencies) can exchange data seamlessly. A standardized tag like:
   - **"Droit des marchés publics" (Public Procurement Law)** 
   ensures that systems using SLS will understand and process the data consistently, avoiding bespoke, incompatible terms.

3. **Enhanced Legal Research**:  
   SLS enables more granular queries, such as:
   - "Show me all cases related to Droit administratif litigated at the Conseil d'État."
   - "Show me all Public Procurement matters across all jurisdictions."

4. **Industry-Wide Adoption**:  
   Aligning French legal taxonomy with SLS helps ensure compatibility with global tools and platforms, allowing French legal systems to integrate with international legal technologies.

## **Potential AI Use Case for French Law**

An AI-driven API based on SLS could automatically tag French legal documents with standardized terms. For instance:
- **Scenario**: A law firm wants to organize its database of Conseil d'État decisions related to urban planning.
- **SLS Solution**: Using tags like "Area of Law = Urbanisme" (Urban Planning), "Service = Contentieux administratif," and "Forum = Conseil d'État," the API could:
  - Automate document tagging.
  - Provide advanced search capabilities, such as "Show me all urban planning disputes heard at the Conseil d'État between 2020 and 2022."

## **Why Align with SLS?**

By adopting SLS, French legal organizations benefit from:
- Standardized legal data representation.
- Enhanced collaboration between national and international legal systems.
- Reduced data silos and improved query capabilities, enabling legal professionals to work more efficiently.
